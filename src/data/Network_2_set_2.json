    "options": [
      "A. It signals the receiver that a packet was delivered in order",
      "B. It lets the sender know a packet was not received correctly",

      "D. It allows the receiver to request retransmission of a lost segment"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Checksums are used to detect bit-level corruption in transmitted data. They do not inform on order (A), correctness at higher levels (B), or request retransmissions directly (D)."

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "UDP uses destination port for demultiplexing. If the same destination port is used, the receiver\u2019s OS will direct those incoming UDP segments to the same socket unless further logic is applied."

      "D. It is only available in TCP and not supported by UDP"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Multiplexing means taking data from multiple sockets or processes and packaging it into transport segments. Both TCP and UDP do this, though in different ways."

      "A. GBN uses an adaptive checksum, while SR does not",
      "B. GBN sends only one packet at a time, whereas SR sends multiple in flight",
      "C. GBN uses cumulative ACKs, while SR sends ACKs for specific packets allowing out-of-order buffering",
      "D. SR relies on negative ACKs exclusively, while GBN uses positive ACKs"
    ],

      "A. It specifically reserves bandwidth for each flow from the start",

    "options": [
      "A. The sender can only send one packet and must await an ACK, causing idle times proportional to RTT",
      "B. The receiver buffers multiple packets simultaneously",

      "D. The checksum is too large for smaller packets"

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "In IPv4, routers can fragment if the packet is too large for the outgoing link MTU, but reassembly is done only at the destination host."
