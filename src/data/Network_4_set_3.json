    "question": "In the 'day in the life' web request scenario, which protocol does a mobile client use to obtain its network configuration (such as an IP address)?",
    "options": ["ARP", "DNS", "DHCP", "TCP"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used by a client to obtain its IP address and other network configuration parameters. ARP and DNS serve different functions, and TCP is a transport protocol."
  },
  {
    "question": "During a web request, which protocol is used to map a domain name to an IP address?",
    "options": ["DHCP", "ARP", "MPLS", "DNS"],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "DNS (Domain Name System) is used to translate human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses. The other protocols do not perform this function."
  },
  {
    "question": "During the ARP process in a web request scenario, what type of frame does the client initially send?",
    "options": [
      "A unicast frame",
      "A multicast frame",
      "Broadcast an ARP request",
      "An anycast frame"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "When a client needs to resolve a MAC address via ARP, it sends out a broadcast frame so that all nodes on the LAN receive the request. Unicast, multicast, or anycast frames are not used for this purpose."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the process of connecting to the Internet, what encapsulation is used to send a DHCP request from the client?",
    "options": [
      "An MPLS packet",

  {
    "question": "How does an Ethernet switch handle a frame when the destination MAC address is not found in its forwarding table?",
    "options": [
      "It drops the frame immediately",
      "It forwards the frame only to the first port",
      "It floods the frame out on all ports except the incoming port",
      "It sends an ARP request to determine the destination"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "When a switch does not know the destination MAC address, it floods the frame to all ports (except the one on which it was received) to ensure the frame reaches its destination. It does not drop the frame or forward it to a single port."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a self-learning switch, when a frame arrives on a given port from a host, what does the switch do with the source MAC address?",
    "options": [
      "It ignores the source MAC address entirely",
      "It immediately broadcasts the source MAC address to all other ports",
      "It replaces the source MAC address with its own",
      "It records the source MAC address and associates it with the incoming port"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "A self-learning switch examines the source MAC address of incoming frames and records it along with the port on which it arrived, building a forwarding table over time. This process requires no manual configuration."
